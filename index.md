### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite of mine because it was my very first esposure to coding! I have never done anything related in this field before, so it was my very first time. I actually enjoy it a lot due to the fact that I got to learn and figure out what I did wrong since when I first submitted Lab 1, I did not commit it correctly. Going back and fixing it all on my own with little guidance was such a rewarding feeling.

* Lab 2
    
    Lab 2 was also a favorite because I got a really good partner mainly. I worked on Lab 1 solo due to me changing classes, so it was my first partner! We were coding viral_math, and the thrill I got when I was contributing to the lab with my partner was so exciting. I remember figuring out how to code the math part and telling my partner, James, and being so hyped during class time since I did it correctly. It was an amazing experience where when I got stuck, he would help and vice versa. It made me become even more passinate about my major, computer science. 

* Lab 3

    If you noticed by now, you can tell I really liked the first three labs. These were really the stepping stones for me. Lab 3 is another favorite of mine since it was the first one that really challenege me. It made my brain hurt, and I couldn;t figure out what to do for the longest of time. For part 2 of this lab, my partner and I had to code in an equation for Julian's Day. It was the first time that we had to change the return value which was really a dilemma for us at the time. It was then that I realized computer science would not be so easy and that I WILL get stuck at times. Either way, it kind of made me appreciate it a lot more and the people who have their careers in this field.
